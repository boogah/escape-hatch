# Escape Hatch

Escape Hatch is a Python script that helps you export your Shuttlecraft posts to a Markdown file.

Requires the `markdownify` package to make everything look pretty:

```
pip install markdownify
```

Run it in the directory containing your Shuttlecraft install:

```
python escape_hatch.py > export.md
```

Better documentation soon? Maybe. Maybe not.
